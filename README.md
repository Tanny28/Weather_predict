# 🌟 AI-Powered Climate Change Tracker 🌍  
> **A Vultr Hackathon Submission**

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Climate Change Tracker** repository!  
This project combines **AI**, **Streamlit**, and **Laravel** to provide predictive climate insights and interactive weather analysis.  
The project leverages Streamlit for the frontend interface and integrates a Laravel-based chatbot powered by Vultr services. Due to time constraints, the entire project couldn't be developed in Laravel, but the chatbot functionality has been seamlessly integrated into the Streamlit application.
